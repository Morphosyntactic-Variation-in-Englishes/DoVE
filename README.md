## A socio-demographic Dataset fOr Varieties of English (v1.0)

DOI: tba

### About 

This dataset comprises extensive socio-demographic information for 71 varieties of English spoken world-wide. DOVE was compiled as part of the project [MoVE](https://sites.google.com/site/katlehret/research/MoVE) (Extra-linguistic triggers of Morphosyntactic Variation in Englishes) and was designed for studying the relationship between extra-linguistic triggers (aka socio-demographic information) and morphosyntactic variation in English varieties, with a focus on language complexity. In total, it comprises information on 16 extra-linguistic triggers which can be broadly assigned to the categories geography, language contact/isolation, socio-history and demography. 

DOVE v1.0 publishes a subset of the full dataset. It samples 17 varieties of English and covers 9 of the extra-linguistic triggers described below. The full dataset will be made publicly available in December 2026.
